# Tom's String Shortener
Shorten any strings to save space

It does encode strings, but you can choose them as strings or turn them into tss files.

## tss could mean both things
- Tom's String Shortener
- Tom's Shorted String

It is mostly intended for Roblox games where you have to store strings in the datastore.

You are free to improve my code, cuz I suck.
